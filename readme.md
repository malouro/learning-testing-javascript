## What is this?

This is a collection of code & notes while going through Kent C. Dodds's Pro Testing course at: [https://testingjavascript.com/](https://testingjavascript.com/)

Some things are a little different -- mostly updating to more recent versions of certain packages (like Jest, Babel, etc.) -- but otherwise the tutorials and examples are followed pretty closely.

I might also add more test files as I start messing around and experimenting.

Cheers, fellow testers 🍻!
